My first repository
My name is Dmitry. I'm 25 years old. I decided to start coding because back in time of my childhood I always dreamt about being a programmer. But somewhere along the way I started to hate math, coding and everything that was somehow related to natural sciences cause of the growing pressure from my father. The dream became a crazy race just for fulfulling my fathers expectations of me being someone he wanted me to be. Now after about 8 years of denial that "I'm not into coding"  I want to try once again just for myself.
